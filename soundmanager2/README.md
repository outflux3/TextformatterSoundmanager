# Soundmanager Players
This folder contains most of the Soundmanager2 players that Scott Schiller created to be used with the underlying api.
This folder structure does not match the SM2 vendor folder due to the structure of that folder having several levels that are unnecessary for the functioning of the players, in addition to the demo audio and video. 

The following players are included.
1. **Bar-UI** /bar-ui/
2. **Page Player** (muxtape.com style) /page-player/
3. **MP3 Buttons** /mp3-player-button/
4. **Playable Links** /play-mp3-links/
5. **360 Player** /360-player/
6. **Cassette Tape** /cassette-tape/

Besides the players, this folder contains the core scripts folder for the system, and the swf folder.
